# `ACCENTURE DATA ANALYTICS AND VISUALISATION VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE PROJECT`

### In this fictional and immersive online experience, I am a Data Analyst at Accenture, and I work on an analysis of sample data sets with visualisations to understand the popularity of different content categories. Within my larger team, each member has a different role and level of responsibility. My team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz. 

### Although in the project, data cleaning, modelling, analysis and visualisation are all done on Excel, I wanted to use Pandas for data cleaning and modelling, PostgreSQL for database solution and Grafana for data visualisation.

## Data (Project) Understanding:
**A data analyst sits between the business and the data.**

 - One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
 - She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
 - Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
 - About Client : [Social Buzz](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf)

#### Task for Accenture : 

 >- Client's Problem that Accenture is tasked to address :  The problem being faced by Social Buzz is the challenge of effectively managing and analysing the massive amount of unstructured data generated from their rapidly growing user base. The company needs to find a solution to efficiently handle and maintain this complex technology infrastructure.
 >- Three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill :                                                                                   
              - An audit of their big data practice ​                                                     
              - Recommendations for a successful IPO ​                                    
              - An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity​

 
 #### Accenture Project Team :

 #### Task for Data Analyst :
 
Read through the client brief and understand the client and business problem at hand.

Analyse the background information provided to identify the requirements that I need to deliver as a data analyst. 

Identify which task should be assigned to me to ensure my team is aligned on deliverables.

 
 
 
 
 - Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
 - So, the first step is to use this [data model](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
 >- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
 >- Content ID
 >- Reaction Types
 >- Content type
 >- Category
 
## Data Cleaning:
#### Clean the data by:
 - removing rows that have values which are missing,
 - changing the data type of some values within a column, and
 - removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
 - - Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

**End result will be three cleaned data set :**
 - [Reaction Types](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/ReactionTypes.csv)
 - [Reactions](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Reactions.csv)
 - [Content](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Content.csv)

## Data Modelling:

**Create a final data set by merging 3 tables**

**End result will be one spreadsheet**
 - A cleaned dataset
 - Top 5 categories
 
 ### Cleaned Data set:
 So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning : [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Cleaned%20Dataset.xlsx)
 

 ## Data Visualization and Storytelling:
 **Make the Powerpoint presentation as per the given template**
 
 **Charts Involved :**
  >- Pie Chart
  >- Bar Chart
  
 - Powerpoint Presentation : [PPT](https://github.com/Sinhaaz/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/PowerPoint%20presentation.pptx)
 

 ## Uncover Insights
 
 Present to the Client:
 **Present your powerpoint presentation to the client and deliver the insights of your analysis**
