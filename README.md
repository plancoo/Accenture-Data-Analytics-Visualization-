# `ACCENTURE DATA ANALYTICS AND VISUALISATION VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE PROJECT`

### In this fictional and immersive online experience, I am a Data Analyst at Accenture, and I work on an analysis of sample data sets with visualisations to understand the popularity of different content categories. Within my larger team, each member has a different role and level of responsibility. My team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz. 

### Although in the project, data cleaning, modelling, analysis and visualisation are all done on Excel, I wanted to use Pandas for data cleaning and modelling, PostgreSQL for database solution and Grafana for data visualisation.

# Project Tasks:

Analyse the background information provided to identify the requirements that I need to deliver as a data analyst.

# Client
Social Buzz is a San Francisco based fast growing company which tracks anonymous user reactions on contents. We are running a 3-month POC focusing on these tasks: ​

- An audit of their big data practice ​

- Recommendations for a successful IPO ​

- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity​

# Business Problem

The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

 The problem being faced by Social Buzz is the challenge of effectively managing and analysing the massive amount of unstructured data generated from their rapidly growing user base. The company needs to find a solution to efficiently handle and maintain this complex technology infrastructure:
 
Over 500 million active users each month producing over 100,000 ​pieces of content per day! ​

How to see where they are with this highly unstructured big data?​

An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity​
